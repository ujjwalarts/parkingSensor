# Parking Sensor 🚗  
### IR-Based Obstacle Detection System  

A simple and efficient IR-based proximity sensing system that detects objects using reflected infrared light, designed for applications like parking sensors and automation.

---

## 📌 Features  
- Detects objects based on reflected IR light intensity.  
- Uses an **IR LED and photodiode** for obstacle detection.  
- **LM741 Op-Amp** acts as a voltage comparator.  
- Adjustable sensitivity using a **1 kΩ potentiometer**.  
- LED indicator lights up upon object detection.  
- Suitable for parking sensors, robotics, and automation.

## 🛠️ Components Used  
- **IR LED**  
- **Photodiode**  
- **LM741 Operational Amplifier**  
- **Resistors** (100 Ω, 10 kΩ)  
- **Potentiometer** (1 kΩ)  
- **LED (Output Indicator)**  
- **Power Supply** (9V Battery)  
- **Connecting Wires, Breadboard/PCB**

## ⚙️ Circuit Working  
1. The **IR LED** emits infrared light.  
2. If an object is present, the **photodiode** detects the reflected IR light.  
3. The **LM741 op-amp** compares the signal with a reference voltage (set by the potentiometer).  
4. If the signal exceeds the threshold, the **output LED** turns ON, indicating object detection.
